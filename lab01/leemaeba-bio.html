    </head>

    <body>
    My name is Leka Lee Maeba, a senior is the Syracuse University iSchool concentrating in Information Security. 
    I enjoy working with technology devices and find cyber security to be the most interesting part.
    I solidified this interest this summer after working as an information security analyst this summer 2022 for the Delaware Department of Technology and Information.
    In the future I plan on tuning this in with my interests in the fashion, sports, or music industries.
