            <p id="content">Basketball shoes were all white until 1985 when Air Jordans were created and later introduced into the league. Converse was the NBA's official footwear at the time but wasn’t willing to put Michael Jordan above other league stars like Magic Johnson. Although they weren’t his first choice, Nike offered Jordan a deal larger than any rookie had ever gotten, and he went on to sign with them. The league banned the first version of Jordan's because of the rule that sneakers should be white and fined Michael Jordans $5,000 each time he wore which Nike paid off to promote the sneaker especially with Jordan being the star he was, this brought a lot of attention to the shoe.</p>
            <p>A new Air Jordan is unveiled every year. Since its introduction in 1985, this yearly event has been welcomed with a growing expectation from the press, the business community, and the buying public. Jordans consistently lead the market in sales and demand, setting higher benchmark standards in design, innovation, and performance with each new model year for the entire athletic footwear sector. One of the the greatest basketball players in history, Michael Jordan, and the shoes he wore during his career, which perfectly encapsulate his unwavering commitment to performance, invention, and achievement, are at the heart of the franchise.</p>

            <p>In 1997, Nike made the decision to give the Air Jordan line complete independence. Nike had to this huge step because it was widely assumed at the time that Michael Jordan would retire after the 1997–98 basketball season. They did this by attempting to convince consumers that the Jump man brand was here to stay even when the face of the brand who was debatably the biggest athlete of that time didn't play. Nike brought players from the Class of 1997 who all possessed strong competitive tendencies and skill levels that made watching them exciting which personified what the Air Jordan brand stood for. This group included Eddie Jones, Ray Allen, Derek Anderson, and others who were all among the first athletes to sign with the Jordan Brand.
            <p>The current generation of Jordans builds on the long heritage of the brand's unique design and unwavering performance. The franchise continues to steer and reshape the athletic footwear market into the future, inspired by the greatest to ever play the game.
                Michael's influence on the AIR JORDAN series endures as his fame spreads.</p>
